The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can sometimes produce unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there are errors in the calculation. For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` works fine, but `calc(100% - 50%)` might produce unexpected results, as it is trying to subtract a percentage from another percentage without a defined base.
